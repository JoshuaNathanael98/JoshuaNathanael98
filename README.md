### Case Study

1. Cyclistic
   Cyclistic In this case study, Cyclistic, a bike sharing company, believes that to improve its growth, it depends on the success of maximizing membership by converting casual riders into members. And to do that, first of all, we need to know how casual and membership riders use bikes differently. By using the historical data, I have found some key findings, such as that Casual riders use bikes for leisure and membership riders use bikes for commutes. In addition, I also give recommendations that the company can take. Please visit [(Cyclistic Case Study)](https://joshuanathanael98.github.io/cyclistic-case-study/) that I have done if you are interested in finding out more about it.
